<p>When Vera was learning English, she had 5 types of toy blocks, one for each of the first 5 uppercase letters. A block can be represented as a 5 × 3 grid with characters <code>.</code> and <code>*</code>. The 5 types of blocks look like the following:</p>

<pre>*** *** *** *** ***
*.* *.* *.. *.* *..
*** *** *.. *.* ***
*.* *.* *.. *.* *..
*.* *** *** *** ***</pre>

<p>Vera has a word S with N letters and wonders what the corresponding sequence of blocks look like when arranged in a row.</p>



## 입력


<p>Line 1 contains integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 2017).</p>

<p>Line 2 contains string S of length N, and consists of only letters A, B, C, D, E.</p>



## 출력


<p>Print 5 lines, each with 3N characters, the corresponding sequence of blocks.</p>
